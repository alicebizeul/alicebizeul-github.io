### About Me

I am a Doctoral Student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/) and an [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) fellow, currently conducting an internship at [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science) in Tübingen, Germany. 

In 2020, I graduated from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) after a Master's Thesis at the [Senseable Intelligence Group, MIT](https://sensein.group) under the supervision of Prof. Satrajit Ghosh. After working on the modelling of 3D brain scans using GANs at MIT, I joined the ETH AI Center in Zürich for my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Julia Vogt and Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf. 

I am broadly interested in **generative modelling, representation learning and (probabilistic) self-supervised methods**, more specifically **understanding** how current methods work and leverage this knowledge to **build better representations of the world**.

More information about me can be found [in my resume](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf)
