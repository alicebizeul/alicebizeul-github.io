abstract: In this paper, we propose, to our best knowledge, the first systematic evaluation framework for GNN explainability, considering explainability on three different “user needs:” explanation focus, mask nature, and mask transformation. We propose a unique metric that combines the fidelity measures and classify explanations based on their quality of being sufficient or necessary.
